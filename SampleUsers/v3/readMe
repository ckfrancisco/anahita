Using Selenium
	Selenium Instructions are held in an HTML table format with 3 columns.
	Columns hold the values: Command, Path, Input
	Recording instructions is a straight forward process.(you will learn as you go)

	Selenium will timeout after 30 seconds of waiting for any action. 
	To increase timeout wait time: 
		add a row to html instruction table with the following format:
		<tr>
    		<td>setTimeout</td>
    		<td>600000</td>
    		<td>Wait 600 seconds for the page</td>
		</tr>
